# User & Preferences Service

This module handles all aspects of user management and personalization, including authentication, profile storage, scientific preferences, and notification settings.

## Setup

1.  Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```
    (This ensures the service runs on port 8001)
